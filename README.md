# Naive Bayes Spam Filter project

In this Dataquest guided project I classify emails from a dataset put together by Tiago A. Almeida and José María Gómez Hidalgo, downloaded from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection), as ham or spam. The goal for this project was 80% accuracy, the filter was almost 99% accurate.
