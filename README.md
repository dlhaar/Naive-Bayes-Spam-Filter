# Naive Bayes Spam Filter project

In this Dataquest guided project I classify emails from a dataset put together by Tiago A. Almeida and José María Gómez Hidalgo, downloaded from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection), as ham or spam. The goal for this project is 80% accuracy.
